 I did a little experiment with a homeless person, not like on them, it's not like electrodes. With them voluntarily helped me. Because the whole idea of giving, right? You've all walked down the street and you've all seen someone begging and you either have or haven't thrown a few pennies in their cup. When you do, you feel good. You bought that feeling. That is a legitimate commercial transaction. Commercial transactions are defined as the exchange of consideration. It was an exchange of consideration here. You gave money. You got the feeling of goodwill. You paid for that feeling. If you didn't give money, you either feel nothing or you feel bad. You can't feel good by not giving. You paid for that feeling. So now the question is, how is that person encouraging us to give? The joke is they act like every corporation in the world. They talk about themselves. Mimi, Mimi, Mimi, right? They sit there with their little outdoor advertising. Little sign. Right? And it says, I'm homeless. I'm hungry. I got 12 kids. I'm a veteran. God bless. They got it all in there. Trying to appeal to somebody. The religious vote. The veteran vote. You know, the child sympathizer. Surround yourself with lots of pets. Go for that one too. All in an attempt to get something from someone. Takers. Not givers. Right? All about me. Well, what do corporations do? We've added more RAM. We've added more RAM. We've added more speed. This one's number one. We're the biggest. We're the best. We've been around since 1969. We're better than them. We're faster than them. We're more efficient than that one. Mimi, Mimi, Mimi, Mimi, Mimi. And so even if we buy their product, guess what? Yeah, I wouldn't really feel much. So I did this little experiment. I found a nice homeless lady on the streets of New York who's willing to help out. And I learned that with her sign, which was pretty typical, I'm homeless. I'm hungry.
